# HealWell Care Hospital – Billing System

This program implements a complete billing workflow for HealWell Care Hospital.  
It follows the exact requirements from Level 1 to Level 8, including:

- Collecting patient details  
- Displaying available services  
- Letting patients select one or more services  
- Fetching corresponding service costs  
- Calculating subtotal  
- Applying senior citizen and high-bill discounts  
- Applying GST  
- Generating a detailed invoice  
- Allowing the admin to update services and costs for the day  

The solution works in **two modes**:

1. **Interactive Mode** – when the program is executed normally  
2. **Evaluation Mode** – using the `solve(input_data)` function (for BT’s test harness)  

The logic is written in a clean, modular form using simple classes.
